## C++ has changed a lot

C++ was first standardised as *ISO/IEC 14882:1998* (C++98), and since then:

- C++11 (huge update)
- C++14 (bug fixes, plus a bit)
- C++17 (fairly hefty)
- C++20 (huge update)

## A (very quick) overview of C++11

- type inference (`auto`{.cpp})
- move semantics
- uniform initialisation
- compile time programming (`constexpr`{.cpp})
- atomic operations
- variadic templates
- lambda expressions
- range-based `for`{.cpp} loops
- `<random>`{.cpp} number generation
- `<chrono>`{.cpp} time library
- *much, much more*

## A (very quick) overview of C++14

- more `constexpr`{.cpp}
- improved lambda support
- function return-type deduction
- digit separators
- standard user-defined literals

## A (very quick) overview of C++17

- more `constexpr`{.cpp}
- cross-platform filesystem library
- parallel STL algorithms
- structured bindings
- class template argument deduction
- mathematical special functions (`std::riemann_zeta`{.cpp}, ...)
- `std::string_view`{.cpp}
- `std::optional`{.cpp}, `std::any`{.cpp}, and `std::variant`{.cpp}

## A (very quick) overview of C++20

- more `constexpr`{.cpp}
- concepts
- modules
- ranges
- coroutines
- 'spaceship' `operator<=>`
- calendar and timezone support
- designated initializers
- `<version>`{.cpp} header
- `std::source_location`{.cpp}
 

## Is this all a bit overwhelming?

How are you supposed to know which features to use and how to use them well?

The trend in C++ has been to add features and then recommend a **reduced subset** of features and some **best practices** that will allow developers to write code that is:

- easier to write
- easier to read
- safer and less prone to errors
- with better performance by default
 

## Is this all a bit overwhelming?

To help navigate the labyrinth of new features and best practices, we have the [C++ core guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) together with a raft of static analysis tools such as [clang tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/).

But the best way to learn is to play around with new features, and that's what we're going to do today.

## Workshop overview

Today we are going to modernise some C++ code!

The code is broken into a number of checkpoints, and each practical session will get us from one checkpoint to the next.

First, let's:

- Log in to the VM with the details provided
- Grab the latest version:

~~~bash
cd ~/RSEConUK2019CppWorkshop
git pull
~~~

## Workshop overview

Next, let's configure, build and run the first checkpoint to ensure everything is working for everyone in the room:

~~~bash
cd ~/RSEConUK2019CppWorkshop/
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make checkpoint_0
./checkpoint_0
~~~

## Workshop overview

Now, let's have a quick look through the code together.

Use your favourite text editor (`CLion`, `VSCode` and `Emacs` are all installed on the VM), open:

~~~bash
~/RSEConUK2019CppWorkshop/checkpoint_0/main.cpp
~~~

## Part 1 — The [filesystem](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) library

C++17 added a filesystem library!

- It's very similar to the boost filesystem library on which it's based
- It has intuitive syntax
- It has useful utilities for dealing with files and directories
- It works well across platforms
- Where possible, we should **always** use it when dealing with files

## Part 1 — The [filesystem](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem) library

~~~cpp
namespace fs = std::filesystem;  // names can be a bit verbose

fs::path p = fs::path("base") / "subdir" / "file.ext";
std::cout << p << '\n';

const bool exists = fs::exists(p);

fs::path new_dir = fs::path(".") / "some" / "new" / "dir";
fs::create_directories(new_dir);
~~~

## Part 1a - the `for` loop

Let's say we have a vector.
The first way we were probably all taught to loop over the contents of a vector was with an index-based `for`{.cpp} loop:

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
   std::cout << v[i] << std::endl;
}
~~~

(Can you spot a subtle issue here?) 

## Iterator-based `for` loop

`std::vector` is a container in the Standard Template Library.
Every container defines its own **iterators**, so we can also loop over a vector in the following way:

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (std::vector<double>::iterator i = v.begin();
     i != v.end(); ++i) {
   std::cout << *i << std::endl;
}
~~~

This can end up looking quite verbose...

## Keyword `auto`

The keyword `auto`{.Cpp} (C++11) tells the compiler to infer the type of a variable.

~~~cpp
auto j = 3;    // j is ???
auto x = 1.2;  // x is ???

std::vector v = {1, 2, 3};     // C++17

auto s = v.size();             // s is ???
auto i = v.begin();            // i is ???
auto d = v.end() - v.begin();  // d is ???
~~~

## Keyword `auto`

The keyword `auto`{.Cpp} (C++11) tells the compiler to infer the type of a variable.

~~~cpp
auto j = 3;    // j is int
auto x = 1.2;  // x is double

std::vector v = {1, 2, 3};     // C++17

auto s = v.size();             // s is ???
auto i = v.begin();            // i is ???
auto d = v.end() - v.begin();  // d is ???
~~~

## Keyword `auto`

The keyword `auto`{.Cpp} (C++11) tells the compiler to infer the type of a variable.

~~~cpp
auto j = 3;    // j is int
auto x = 1.2;  // x is double

std::vector v = {1, 2, 3};     // C++17

auto s = v.size();             // s is std::size_t
auto i = v.begin();            // i is std::vector<int>::iterator
auto d = v.end() - v.begin();  // d is std::ptrdiff_t
~~~

## Keyword `auto`

Use `auto`{.Cpp} when you **don't know** or when you **don't care** what the type of the variable is.

Often, we don't care what the type of a variable is - we're happy for the compiler to 'do the right thing'.
Replacing it with `auto`{.Cpp} *can* make our code easier to read and less prone to errors.

Sometimes *only* the compiler knows the type of a variable - we'll see this later with lambdas.


## Iterator-based `for` loop using `auto`

In the context of an iterator-based `for` loop, we can simplify the syntax by using `auto`{.Cpp} to infer the type returned by `v.begin()`:

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (auto i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i) {
   std::cout << *i << std::endl;
}
~~~

Not only does it look nicer, but it's **easier to read** and **less prone to errors**.

## Range-based loops

Range-based loops have the most compact syntax and are often the most intuitive to use.
They work with any container that defines `begin` and `end` methods.

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (double x: v) {
   std::cout << x << std::endl;
}
~~~

## Range-based loops using `auto`

You can use `auto`{.Cpp} here if you don't care about the type...

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (auto x: v) {
   std::cout << x << std::endl;  // x is a value
}
~~~

## Range-based loops using `auto` with qualifiers

You can use `auto&`{.Cpp} if you want a reference...

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (auto& x: v) {
   x += 1.0;  // x is a reference
}
~~~

## Range-based loops using `auto` with qualifiers

You can use `const auto&`{.Cpp} if you want a const reference...

~~~cpp
std::vector<double> v = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0};

for (const auto& x: v) {
   std::cout << x << std::endl;  // x is a const reference
}
~~~

## Task 1

We currently have hardcoded paths to three data files. That's not great!

Write some code that will:

- Recursively search through your entire home directory
- Add any data files that end with `"_rse_workshop.dat"`{.cpp} to a `std::vector<fs::path>`{.cpp}
  - hint: strings have a `.ends_with()` method since C++20
- Print out all the data files you found

## Part 2 - Moving beyond the `for` loop: STL algorithms

Having just told you about all the great new ways you can write a `for`{.cpp} loop, we're going to spend the rest of the workshop trying to convince you to use them as little as possible!

~~~cpp
std::vector v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Option 1
int sum1 = 0;
for (const auto x : v) {
   sum1 += x;
}

// Option 2 (<numeric> header)
const int sum2 = std::accumulate(v.begin(), v.end(), 0);
~~~


## Using the [algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm) library

Things about option 2:

- `sum2` is `const`{.cpp}
- the operation has an explicit name (accumulate)
- you are conveying your intent to the compiler
- it's more concise
- it requires another header...


## Using the [algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm) library

There are algorithms for:

- Adding things up (`std::accumulate`{.cpp}, `std::reduce`{.cpp})
- Doing "something" to a range (`std::transform`{.cpp})
- Doing "something" to a range and then adding up (`std::inner_product`{.cpp}, `std::transform_reduce`{.cpp})
- Sorting (`std::sort`{.cpp})
- Rotating (`std::rotate`{.cpp})
- Permuting (`std::next_permutation`{.cpp})
- Many, many other things


## Task 2

We're currently using a `for`{.cpp} loop to calculate the mean and the variance. Yuck!

Replace those for loops with:

- Algorithms!
- First, try `std::accumulate`{.cpp} and `std::inner_product`{.cpp}
- Then, try `std::reduce`{.cpp} and `std::transform_reduce`{.cpp}


## Part 3 - customising algorithms

Many algorithms allow customisation.

~~~ cpp
template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
void sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );
~~~

Here, `std::sort`{.cpp} is templated over `class Compare`{.cpp} (as well as the iterator type). How can we make use of this customisation point?

There are several ways, but usually the most convenient in modern C++ is the **lambda function**.


## The lambda function

You can define a **lambda function** within the current scope:

~~~cpp
auto empty_lambda = [](){};

auto hello = [](std::string name) {
      std::cout << "hello " << name << std::endl;
    };

hello("world");  // prints "hello world"
~~~

With a lambda function, you **cannot** specify the type, so we rely on the keyword `auto`{.cpp}.


## The lambda function

The square brackets **capture** variables from the outside scope, for example

~~~cpp
int i = 1;
auto add_i_to_arg = [i](int arg) { return arg + i; };
std::cout << add_i_to_arg(3) << std::endl;  // prints 4
~~~

This captures `i` by value. To capture by reference use `&`:

~~~cpp
int i = 1;
auto add_arg_to_i = [&i](int arg) { i += arg; };
add_arg_to_i(3);
std::cout << i << std::endl;  // prints 4
~~~

## The lambda function

You can capture all variables used in the lambda function using either `[=]`,
which captures everything by value, or `[&]`, which captures everything by
reference:

~~~cpp
int i = 1;
auto add_i_to_arg = [=](int arg) { return arg + i; };
std::cout << add_i_to_arg(3) << std::endl; // prints 4

auto add_arg_to_i = [&](int arg) { i += arg; };
add_arg_to_i(3);
std::cout << i << std::endl;  // prints 4
~~~


## Using lambdas with algorithms

Let's sort a range largest to smallest rather than smallest to largest...

~~~cpp

std::vector v = {4.53, 2.38, 3.45, 9.68};

auto sort_greater = [](double x, double y) { return x > y; };
std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), sort_greater);

std::cout << v.at(0) << '\n';  // prints 9.68

~~~


## Task 3

We're currently using a `for`{.cpp} loop to calculate the skew. Yuck!

Replace that for loop with a call to `std::transform_reduce`{.cpp}

- You'll need to write your own Lambda, which might
  - capture `mean` and `std`
  - take a `double`{.cpp} as parameter
  - the default binary operation for reducing is `std::plus<>()`{.cpp}


## Part 4 - other [algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm)

There are many algorithms in the standard library!

It is well worth having a good working knowledge of what is available

- Some would be hard to implement efficiently yourself
- Many save you a lot of code
- All make your intent clearer to the compiler
- Most make your intent clearer to other humans


## Part 4a - a [`<chrono>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono) digression

`<chrono>` tracks time, and is one of the real gems of C++11.

It's also been updated for C++20 with calendar and timezone support!

~~~cpp
auto t1 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
auto t2 = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();

std::chrono::duration<double, std::milli> ms = t2 - t1;
std::cout << ms.count() << " ms\n";
~~~


## Task 4

First:

- Take 5-10 minutes to **read** the list of algorithms
- Click through onto any that you think sound interesting
- Look at some of the examples - get a feel for what is available!

Then:

- Select an appropriate algorithm to calculate the **median** in section 4
- Observe whether your new version is faster than the original. Why (or why not)?


## Task 5 - even more algorithms!

There are another two operations on `v` being performed in Section 5.  Try to replace those with appropriate algorithms.

Then, spend some time playing around with some other algorithms:

- Either on `v`, or a new container you create yourself
- What does `std::rotate` do?
- Can you think of a use-case for `std::next_permutation`?
- Have you ever written your own `std::max_element`?


## Part 6 - parallel [`<execution>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/execution)? Out of the box?!

That's right - C++ 17 supports* parallel execution out-of-the-box.

You can add:

~~~ cpp
std::execution::seq        // sequential
std::execution::par        // parallel
std::execution::par_unseq  // parallel and vectorised
std::execution::unseq      // C++20: vectorised
~~~

as the first parameter to all parallel algorithms.

\* gcc 10.x requires linking against a newish version of Intel's TBB library


## Task 6

- Go back through all the algorithms you have used, and add execution policies to them
- Think about where it would be appropriate to do so
- Time some examples with and without different policies
  - Are they faster? No? Why not?


## Task 7

The final task. Section 7 puts the contents of `v` back out to a file in CSV format using some hard-coded directory and file manipulations, and with a naked `for`{.cpp} loop.

We don't like that much at all.

Drawing on the filesystem library and standard algorithms, have a go at rewriting this section of code.

- Hint: `std::string`{.cpp} has an `operator+`{.cpp} too
